2. In `controllers`, create the `burgers_controller.js` file.

3. Inside the `burgers_controller.js` file, import the following:

   * Express
   * `burger.js`

4. Create the `router` for the app, and export the `router` at the end of your file.

#### View setup

1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `views`.

   * Create the `index.handlebars` file inside `views` directory.

   * Create the `layouts` directory inside `views` directory.

     * Create the `main.handlebars` file inside `layouts` directory.

     * Setup the `main.handlebars` file so it's able to be used by Handlebars.

     * Setup the `index.handlebars` to have the template that Handlebars can render onto.

     * Create a button in `index.handlebars` that will submit the user input into the database.
